To understand an emergent system, you cannot merely study the behavior of its parts and stop there. New behaviors come from <em>interactions</em> between these parts, and a new set of intellectual tools are required to reason about these behaviors. This includes several principles cataloged in this index, including <a href="">feedback</a>, <a href="">critical phenomena</a>, and <a href="">evolution</a>.</p><p>Before we get into these powerful intellectual tools, let’s take our first direct glimpse of emergence in action.</p><h1>Our first model</h1><p>In thinking about systems, it is helpful to start with simple models which are easy to think about and run on computers. So let’s start with a super-simple model – freezing particles.</p><div class="FlexRow"><div>
Black particles are not frozen. They bounce around randomly.<div><canvas width="150" height="150" style="display:block;margin:20px auto;background:white;filter:blur(4px)"></canvas></div></div><div>
Green particles are frozen. They sit still.<div><canvas width="150" height="150" style="display:block;margin:20px auto;background:white;filter:blur(4px)"></canvas></div></div><div>
When a black particle touches a green particle, it freezes into a green particle<div><canvas width="150" height="150" style="display:block;margin:20px auto;background:white;filter:blur(4px)"></canvas></div></div></div><p>The <em>parts</em> of this system are the particles. Particles are simple – all they do is move randomly and stick together sometimes. We would expect the behavior of a system made of many of these particles to be just as simple. One good guess: blobs of particles will grow around any frozen “seeds”.</p><p>So let’s find out! Here is a system with one hundred times as many particles as the little boxes above:</p><div><canvas width="300" height="300" style="display:block;margin:20px auto;background:white;filter:blur(4px)"></canvas></div><p>When you’re ready, <button style="text-align:center">drop a frozen seed in the center</button>.</p><p>The result doesn’t match our guess at all. Instead of forming a blob, freezing particles grow outward from the seed, like a tree’s roots or electric sparks.</p><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap" idyll="[object Object]"><img src="static/roots.jpg" height="200" style="width:unset" alt="Roots of a mangrove tree" idyll="[object Object]"/><img src="static/sparks.jpg" height="200" style="width:unset" alt="Lightning" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><p>Together, the particles make a pattern which was not encoded in their rules. We didn’t tell the particles to make a branching pattern. The pattern <em>emerged</em>.</p><p>To see how the pattern continues, at a higher level of scale, here is a system with nine times as many particles as last time:</p><div><canvas width="300" height="300" style="display:block;margin:20px auto;background:white;filter:blur(4px)"></canvas></div><p>When you’re ready, <button style="text-align:center">drop a frozen seed in the center</button>.</p><h1>Credits</h1><ul><li>Text: Joshua Horowitz &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/albertwenger">Albert Wenger</a></li><li>Simulation: Joshua Horowitz</li><li>Flock of birds: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Starling_murmuration.jpg">Walter Baxter / A murmuration of starlings at Gretna / CC BY-SA 2.0</a></li><li>Roots: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roots_by_cesarpb.jpg">Cesar Paes Barreto / Stilt roots of a Rhizophora mangrove tree / free</a></li><li>Lightning: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scottobear_-_051231_sun_(by-sa">Scotto Bear / sunset/lightning / CC BY-SA 2.0</a>.jpg)</li></ul></div></div></div></div>
